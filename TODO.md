#Eve Web Audio Synthesizer
#NOTES:
* Custom Events will require capitalizing HTML data-attributes in the short term (fix THAT later)
* Figure out a good place to bind events
* Reduce HTML as much as possible


#OLD INFORMATION
##Next Steps:

* Put playing keys in an array for portamento

##OLD TODOs:

* Harmonic Osc needs modulation amounts moved into each channel
  * lfo (positive and negative)
  * envelope (positive only)

* Delay

* Gulp
  * write minified files in the conventional way
  * minify HTML
  * don't commit minfiles
