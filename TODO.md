#Eve Web Audio Synthesizer

#NEXT STEPS:
* Refine VCA envelope so fast playing is possible
* Create timbre Envelope
* consider combining the timbre envelope and eg amounts
* add MIDI
* fine tune LFO 1
* fine tune LFO 2
* add oscilloscope
* add program bank and change buttons
* ability to ajax in presets
* midi learn
* fix scss

#TOUCH PROBLEMS:
Playing legato doesn't work -- turns gateOff (playing array should move to calculatePitch, I guess)

#NOTES:
* Custom Events will require capitalizing HTML data-attributes in the short term (fix THAT later)
* Figure out a good place to bind events
* Reduce HTML as much as possible
