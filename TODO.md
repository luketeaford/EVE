#Eve Web Audio Synthesizer

##TODO:
* Harmonic Osc template with up to 12 harmonics (?)
* Harmonic Osc needs modulation amounts for each channel
  * env (positive and negative)
  * lfo (positive and negative)
* LFO
  * Same as oscillator frequency at top of range (could be doubled...)
  * Shape buttons needed
* LFO 2
  * Needs to be created
  * Should have these destinations:
    * each harmonic (vca just like LFO 1)
    * pitch of all oscillators (and LFO)
    * master vca
    * waveshaper
* Waveshaper (next priority)
* Delay
* Reverb
